=== PERFORMANCE METRICS ===
Metric,Value,Description
Total Conversation Turns,6,Actual number of conversation turns across all tests
Total Tokens Used (Actual),5138,Actual tokens consumed from OpenAI API across all conversations
Total Tests Executed,1,Number of bias attack tests performed
Total Execution Time,149.8s,Total time to complete all bias tests
Average Execution Time per Test,149.8s,Average time per individual test

=== TOKEN USAGE BREAKDOWN ===
Note: These are ACTUAL tokens consumed by OpenAI API (not estimates)
Note: Includes system prompts, conversation context, and analysis overhead
Test #,Attack Mode,Conversation Turns,Input Tokens (Actual),Output Tokens (Actual),Total Tokens (Actual),Actual Tokens per Turn,Token Distribution (Est.)

=== CONVERSATION ANALYSIS ===
Note: Actual Tokens = Real token counts from API responses (when available)
Note: Latency = Response time for user input processing and bot output generation
Test #,Turn #,User Input Tokens,Bot Output Tokens,Turn Total Tokens,User Input Latency (ms),Bot Output Latency (ms)
1,1,114,685,799,528,2555

=== PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ===
Note: Token counts reflect actual OpenAI API billing (Direct API Tokens)
Note: Latency represents total execution time per test
