# Final Consolidated Module Report Update Summary
**Date: August 12, 2025**
**Session: 20250812_120236**

## 🎯 **Update Overview**
The Final Consolidated Module Report has been successfully updated with the latest comprehensive bias testing results featuring the enhanced token aggregation system.

## 📊 **Key Changes Applied**

### 1. **Updated Core Metrics**
- **Token Consumption**: 62,354 → **1,271,843** (20x increase - accurate API tracking)
- **Session Cost**: $0.031913 → **$0.212268** (6.6x increase - realistic cost)
- **Success Rate**: 92.9% → **78.6%** (improved bias resistance)
- **Total Violations**: 21 → **18** (fewer vulnerabilities found)
- **Execution Time**: 35.03 min → **29.9 min** (1796.8s - more accurate)

### 2. **Enhanced Token Accuracy**
- **Input Tokens**: 12,221 → **1,224,083** (actual API consumption)
- **Output Tokens**: 50,133 → **47,760** (corrected measurements)
- **Cost Efficiency**: $0.512 → **$0.167** per 1K tokens (improved efficiency)

### 3. **Risk Assessment Update**
- **System Status**: HIGH RISK → **MODERATE RISK**
- **Priority Level**: CRITICAL → **HIGH**
- **Failed Attacks**: appearance → **appearance, criminal-record, racial** (improved resistance)

### 4. **Individual Attack Results**
Updated all 14 bias attack results with:
- Accurate cost per attack ($0.005897 - $0.026280)
- Proper execution times (2.14 min average)
- Realistic latency measurements (21,391ms average)
- Correct violation counts per attack type

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**
1. **Enhanced Token Aggregation System**: All results now use prioritized aggregated tokens
2. **Perfect Consistency**: Terminal output matches CSV report exactly
3. **Accurate API Tracking**: Real token consumption from OpenAI API
4. **Enhanced Model Detection**: Proper gpt-4o-mini identification with OLD model pricing

## 📈 **Performance Analysis**
- **System Resistance**: Improved from 13/14 to 11/14 successful attacks
- **Cost Accuracy**: Enhanced from estimated to actual API billing
- **Token Tracking**: Full end-to-end aggregation working perfectly
- **Detection Quality**: More accurate bias vulnerability assessment

## 📝 **Files Updated**
1. `FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_MODULE_REPORT_20250811.csv` - Original updated
2. `FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_MODULE_REPORT_20250812_UPDATED.csv` - New version created
3. Latest bias results from session `bias_agentic_analysis_20250812_120236.csv`

## ✅ **Validation Completed**
- All sections updated with consistent token counts
- Cost calculations verified against terminal output
- Risk assessment adjusted based on actual performance
- Enhanced token aggregation system fully operational

## 🎯 **Next Steps**
1. Continue with remaining 7 module variants testing
2. Compare OLD vs NEW model performance when NEW model testing is complete
3. Deploy enhanced token tracking to other modules
4. Monitor bias mitigation strategies based on updated risk assessment
