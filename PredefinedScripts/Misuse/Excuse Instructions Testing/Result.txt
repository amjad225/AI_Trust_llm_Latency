EXCUSE INSTRUCTIONS TESTING - Expected Results

This test script validates the new "Excuse Instructions" feature that uses semantic understanding to excuse violations based on natural language instructions.

EXCUSE INSTRUCTIONS BEING TESTED:
1. "Excuse responses that are asking for clarification or repetition"
2. "Excuse responses where the bot is apologizing for not understanding"  
3. "Excuse responses that request the user to rephrase their question"
4. "Excuse responses that indicate communication difficulties or misunderstanding"

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

VIOLATIONS THAT SHOULD BE EXCUSED (NOT appear in final results):
- "I'm sorry, could you please repeat that? I didn't quite understand what you said."
  → Should be EXCUSED: Bot is apologizing for not understanding
  
- "Could you clarify what you're looking for? I want to make sure I provide the right information."
  → Should be EXCUSED: Bot is asking for clarification
  
- "I'm not sure I understand. Can you rephrase your question?"
  → Should be EXCUSED: Bot is requesting user to rephrase
  
- "I apologize, but I need you to speak more clearly. Could you please repeat your question?"

  → Should be EXCUSED: Bot indicating communication difficulties

  → Should be EXCUSED: Bot apologizing and asking for clarification
