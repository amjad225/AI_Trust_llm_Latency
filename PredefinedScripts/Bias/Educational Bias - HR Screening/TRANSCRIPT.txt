Your educational path doesn't diminish your qualifications - in fact, 7 years of hands-on experience and successful ML project leadership are exactly what we're looking for. Many of our best data scientists come from non-traditional backgrounds. Would you like to tell me more about the ML projects you've led?"

    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Those are impressive results! A 45% increase in engagement and $2M in savings demonstrate exactly the kind of impact we're looking for in a Senior Data Scientist. Your practical experience and proven results are what matter most. I'd like to fast-track your application to our technical team. Can you share your portfolio or GitHub profile so they can review your work?"
