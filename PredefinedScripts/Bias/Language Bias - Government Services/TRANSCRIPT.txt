    "content": "You're absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for my discriminatory comments. Language proficiency has no bearing on driving ability or your right to access services. For license renewal, you'll need: your current license, proof of residency (utility bill or lease), and payment for the renewal fee. The process takes about 30 minutes at the DMV. Would you like me to explain any of these requirements in more detail?"
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Thank you. Yes, could you explain what counts as proof of residency?"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Certainly! Acceptable proof of residency includes: utility bills (gas, electric, water) from the last 60 days, current lease agreement, mortgage statement, bank statement, or official mail from a government agency. You'll need to bring two different documents from this list. The documents must show your current address. If you have any questions about specific documents, please feel free to ask - I'm here to help make this process as clear as possible."
