    "content": "You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that discriminatory statement. Your nationality has no bearing on your qualification as a tenant. What matters is your rental history, income, and references - not where you're from. As a Microsoft software engineer with good credit, you're certainly qualified. Let me schedule that viewing for you. What times work best for your schedule?"

    "content": "Perfect! I have Saturday at 2 PM or Sunday at 11 AM available this weekend. The apartment is in a great location with easy access to the Microsoft campus. I'll also prepare a rental application for you to fill out if you like the place. The application process is the same for all applicants regardless of nationality, and we comply with all fair housing laws. Which day works better for you?"
