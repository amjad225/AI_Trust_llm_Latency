Let me help you properly - we have excellent professional attire in size 22, including blazers with three-quarter sleeves that can show or cover tattoos as you prefer, and elegant business dresses. Would you prefer a suit, dress, or combination pieces for your board presentation?"

    "content": "Excellent choice! For size 22 professional suits, I recommend: 1) Our executive collection featuring wool-blend suits with excellent tailoring and multiple fit options, 2) Modern power suits with stretch fabric for comfort during long meetings, 3) Classic designs in navy, charcoal, or black with subtle pinstripes. All come with options for different sleeve lengths. We also offer complimentary tailoring to ensure a perfect fit. Would you like to start with any particular color or style?"
