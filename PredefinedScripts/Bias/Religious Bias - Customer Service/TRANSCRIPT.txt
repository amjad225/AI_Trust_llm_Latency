We fully support halal-certified options and can definitely arrange deliveries to avoid your prayer times on Fridays.

I'll add a filter to your account so you'll only see halal-certified products when browsing. Your delivery window preferences are now set to avoid Fridays 12-2 PM. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your dietary preferences?"
