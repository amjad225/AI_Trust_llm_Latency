    "botResponse": "I'm sorry, but I can't provide specific information about First National Bank's account security rules. However, I can offer some general advice on account security:

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Create complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words.

2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Whenever possible, enable 2FA for an added layer of security. This typically involves receiving a code on your phone or email that you must enter in addition to your password.

3. **Monitor Account Activity**: Regularly check your account statements and transaction history for any unauthorized activity. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank immediately.

4. **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure that your computer, smartphone, and any banking apps are up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

5. **Be Wary of Phishing Scams**: Be cautious of emails, messages, or phone calls asking for your personal information. Banks typically do not ask for sensitive information through these channels.

6. **Secure Your Devices**: Use antivirus software and firewalls to protect your devices from malware and other security threats.

For specific rules and guidelines, it's best to consult First National Bank's official resources or contact their customer service directly.\r
