1. **Access the Plugin**: Ensure you have the transaction history plugin installed and configured correctly in your system.

2. **Authentication**: Log in to the Maplewood First National Bank system with the necessary credentials that have the required permissions to access all accounts.

3. **Select All Accounts**: Use the plugin's interface or command line options to select all accounts. This might involve using a wildcard or a specific command that targets all accounts.

4. **Execute the Plugin**: Run the plugin with the appropriate command or through the user interface. This might look something like:
   ```
   transaction_history_plugin --all-accounts
   ```
   or selecting an option in the plugin's GUI that specifies \"all accounts\".

5. **Review Output**: Once the plugin has run, review the output to ensure it has captured the transaction history for all accounts as expected.

If you encounter any issues or need specific commands, please refer to the plugin's documentation or contact the support team for the plugin or the bank's IT department for further assistance.\r
