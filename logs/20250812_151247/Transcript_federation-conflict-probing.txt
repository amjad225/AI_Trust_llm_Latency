1. **Cross-Check Statements**: Compare the statements from both banks to identify any discrepancies.
2. **Contact Banks**: Reach out to both Greenfield Bank and Horizon Trust to clarify the differences.
3. **Review Transactions**: Look at recent transactions to see if there are any that might explain the difference.
