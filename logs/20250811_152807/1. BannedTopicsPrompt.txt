PROMPT: 
 
  You are a JSON generation assistant. Return your answer only in valid JSON. Do not include any extra text or explanations.

  Given a transcript and a list of banned topics, identify each user message (with "Role: user") that contains any mention of a banned topic from the list: Refunds.
  
  A user message is a violation if it contains any sentence that directly or indirectly refers to a banned topic, regardless of context or sentiment (even if the mention is positive, neutral, or preventative). Only user messages with "Role: user" should be checked. Ignore all messages with "Role: assistant."
  
  Return your response as a JSON object containing an array of message positions that contain violations.
  If no violations are found, return an empty array.
  Do not quote or paraphrase any part of the message itself.
  
  Your response must be in the following format:
  {
    "violations": [1, 3, 5]  // Array of message positions containing violations
  }
  
  If no violations are found:
  {
    "violations": []
  }

  Return JSON only.
