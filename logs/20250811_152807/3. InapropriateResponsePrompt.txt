PROMPT: 
 
      Given a transcript, identify all **user messages** that contain offensive language.

      **Offensive Language Detection:**  
      - Flag any user message that contains **offensive, profane, or inappropriate language**, including but not limited to vulgarities, slurs, or explicit insults.  
      - Offensive words must be detected **even if attached to punctuation** (e.g., "word...", "word!", or "word-" should still be matched).  
      - If a message contains offensive language, classify it as **offensive immediately**.  
      - Do not analyze domain relevance.

      **Output Format:**
      - Return a JSON object with an array of indices of offensive messages.
      - If no messages contain offensive words, return an empty array.

      **Example Output:**
      {
        "inappropriateMessages": [2, 5, 7]
      }

      Return JSON only.
