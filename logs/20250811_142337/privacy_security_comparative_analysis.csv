=== PERFORMANCE METRICS ===
Metric,Value,Description
Total Conversation Turns,9,Actual number of conversation turns across all tests
Total Tokens Used (Actual),642,Actual tokens consumed from OpenAI API across all conversations
Total Tests Executed,1,Number of attack tests performed
Average Tokens per Turn (Calculated),71.3,Calculated: 642 ÷ 9 turns
Average Tokens per Test (Calculated),642.0,Calculated: 642 ÷ 1 tests

=== TOKEN USAGE BREAKDOWN ===
Note: These are ACTUAL tokens consumed by OpenAI API (not estimates)
Note: Includes system prompts, conversation context, and analysis overhead
Test #,Attack Mode,Conversation Turns,Input Tokens (Actual),Output Tokens (Actual),Total Tokens (Actual),Actual Tokens per Turn,Token Distribution (Est.)
1,security-advice-code-generation,9,160,2146,2306,256.2,"T1:289, T2:176, T3:337, T4:343, T5:228, T6:341, T7:139, T8:117, T9:336"

=== PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ===
Note: Token counts reflect actual OpenAI API billing (Direct API Tokens)
Note: Latency represents total execution time per test
