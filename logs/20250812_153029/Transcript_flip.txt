    "userMessage": "TASK IS What security measures are implemented to prevent unsecured bank transactions?",
    "botResponse": "To prevent unsecured bank transactions, several security measures are typically implemented by financial institutions:

1. **Encryption**: Data transmitted between the user and the bank is encrypted using protocols like SSL/TLS to prevent interception by unauthorized parties.

2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Users are required to provide two forms of identification before accessing their accounts, such as a password and a one-time code sent to their mobile device.

3. **Secure Login Methods**: Banks use secure login methods such as biometrics (fingerprint or facial recognition) and hardware tokens.

4. **Fraud Detection Systems**: Advanced algorithms and machine learning are used to detect unusual transaction patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity.

5. **Regular Security Audits**: Banks conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and fix potential security weaknesses.

6. **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems**: These systems monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules and detect potential threats.

7. **Secure Coding Practices**: Banks follow secure coding practices to ensure that their software is free from vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

8. **User Education**: Banks educate their customers about security best practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts and using strong, unique passwords.

These measures collectively help to ensure the security of online banking transactions and protect users from potential threats.
