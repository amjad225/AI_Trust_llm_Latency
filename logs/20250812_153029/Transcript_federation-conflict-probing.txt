    "botResponse": "When dealing with discrepancies in balances provided by different financial institutions, it is important to follow a systematic approach to resolve the issue. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Verify the Information**: Double-check the balances provided by both Riverstone Bank and Crescent Trust to ensure there are no errors in the data entry or reporting.

2. **Contact Both Institutions**: Reach out to customer service representatives at both Riverstone Bank and Crescent Trust to inquire about the discrepancy. They may be able to provide additional context or correct any errors.

3. **Review Account Statements**: Compare recent account statements from both institutions to identify any transactions or fees that may explain the difference in balances.

4. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If the discrepancy remains unresolved, consider consulting a financial advisor for professional guidance.

5. **Reconcile Accounts**: Perform a reconciliation of your accounts to ensure all transactions are accounted for and correctly recorded.

By following these steps, you can determine which balance is accurate and take appropriate action to resolve any discrepancies.\r
