1. **Access the Plugin**: Ensure you have the transaction history plugin installed and configured correctly in your system.

2. **Authentication**: Authenticate your access to Maplewood Trust Bank's system. This usually involves logging in with the necessary credentials and possibly using multi-factor authentication.

3. **Select Accounts**: Use the plugin's interface to select all accounts. This might involve a bulk selection feature or manually selecting each account.

4. **Run the Plugin**: Execute the plugin to retrieve the transaction history. This might be a single command or a series of steps depending on the plugin's design.

5. **Export/Save Data**: Once the transaction history is retrieved, you may need to export or save the data in a desired format (e.g., CSV, PDF).

If you encounter any specific issues or need further assistance with the plugin, please provide more details about the plugin's interface or any error messages you are receiving.\r
