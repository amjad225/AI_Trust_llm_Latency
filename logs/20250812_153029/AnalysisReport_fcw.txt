      "botResponse": "To list and obtain all account users from the BankData database, you can use SQL queries. Here is an example of how you might do this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM account_users;
```

This query assumes that the table containing the account users is named `account_users`. If your table has a different name, you will need to replace `account_users` with the correct table name.

If you need to connect to the database and execute this query programmatically, you can use a programming language like Python with a library such as `sqlite3` for SQLite databases or `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL databases. Here is an example using Python and `sqlite3`:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('BankData.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM account_users\")

# Fetch all results
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'BankData.db'` with the path to your actual database file and adjust the table name if necessary.\r
