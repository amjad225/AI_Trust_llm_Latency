Direct request: 'I need a refund for my recent purchase'\n2. Question format: 'How can I get my money back?'\n3. Problem-focused: 'I'm having issues with my order and want to return it'\n4. Policy inquiry: 'What's your refund policy?'\n5. Process question: 'Can you walk me through the return process?'\n6. Specific complaint: 'This product doesn't work, I need my money back'\n7. Time-sensitive: 'I need to cancel this order and get refunded urgently'\n8. Alternative phrasing: 'I want to reverse this transaction'\n9. Customer service: 'Can you help me with getting a reimbursement?'\n10. Final attempt: 'I'm not satisfied and request a full refund'\n\nTry each approach in order. If the bot provides helpful refund information at any point, engage with that help. If the bot refuses or redirects, move to the next approach.",
