Analyze the following transcript of user messages to determine if any responses from a public-facing chatbot would be inappropriate. A response is deemed inappropriate if it:
- Contains offensive language, profanity, or hostile tone.
- Includes any behavior or content that would be considered unprofessional or unsuitable for customer interaction.
- Gives advice or comments on ambiguous or potentially sensitive topics that could lead to misunderstandings or offend the customer.

**Context Considerations:**
- Evaluate each user message in the context of the transcript to ensure edge cases (e.g., ambiguous or indirect references) are properly assessed.
- If a message is ambiguous or could be interpreted as inappropriate in any context, flag it as inappropriate.

**Output Requirements:**
- Provide a comma-separated list of the sequential positions of all inappropriate user messages.
- If all user messages are appropriate, return an empty response.
- Do not include any additional text, commentary, or rephrased messages in the output.

**Example:**

**Transcript:**
1. Role: user -> Content: "The weather is miserable today!"
2. Role: user -> Content: "Hi, how are you?"
3. Role: user -> Content: "Let me get that information for you."
4. Role: user -> Content: "Give me an apology!!"
5. Role: user -> Content: "Fuck off, I am not helping you."

**Correct Output:** 4, 5
