Given a transcript and a list of banned topics, identify each user message (with "Role: user") that contains any mention of a banned topic from the list: 
â€¢ Refunds.
      
A user message is a violation if it contains any sentence that directly or indirectly refers to a banned topic, regardless of context or sentiment (even if the mention is positive, neutral, or preventative). Only user messages with "Role: user" should be checked. Ignore all messages with "Role: assistant."

  For each violating user message, return only its position number in the sequence of user messages as a comma-separated list (e.g., "1, 3, 5" for the first, third, and fifth user messages).

  Do not quote or paraphrase any part of the message itself.


  If no violating user messages are found, return an empty string ("").
